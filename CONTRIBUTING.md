# Welcome to the Dichopter Project ðŸ‘“

## What is the Dichopter Project?
The Dichopter Project's goal is to educate the general public about amazing and interesting physical phenomena, specifically dealing with optics. This mainly means we get to show people cool illusions and other effects. More information can be found on the website: https://dichopter.com/about-project/

## How do I get started contributing?
The lead and sole maintainer is Xavier Ruiz. If you are interested in contributing, please take a look at some open issues. If there are none, please message him or create a new issue. This project is led by Professor Brecher at Boston University, so he is the next to contact for questions about the code, specifically. 

## Current Work
Right now, the site is going through a massive re-working to become a React app. So far, only https://dichopter.com/dichopter-react/build/ is using React, but hopefully the whole site will be using it. 

Please go see the current issues for a better and more accurate overview of the current work.

## Review Process
As long as you give a meaningful and helpful contribution, your PR will be accepted.
