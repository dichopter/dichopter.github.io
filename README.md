The Dichopter Project aims to provide the user with hardware and software tools to help them explore dichoptic vision â€“ that is, two eyed or binocular vision where two images are presented to the left and right eye separately. These pairs of images can be of many kinds: they can be the same image; or they can be two different ones leading to the perception of depth (stereo pairs); or two different images with neither one containing sufficient information to form a single image (e.g., random dot stereograms); or two different color images leading to the percept of another color (e.g., red to one eye, green to the other possibly leading to the percept of yellow); or images presented separately in time; and many other possible pair combinations.
